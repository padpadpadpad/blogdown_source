# Who am I?

I'm an ecologist studying how organisms adapt to change and how ecological processes scale from the very small (metabolism of a single cell) to the very big (ecosystem functions such as primary production).

I finished my PhD in Cornwall under the supervision of Gabriel Yvon-Durocher and Angus Buckling in July 2017 and have now started a postdoc position with Angus looking at the importance of both ecological and evolutionary to community interactions, evolution and stability.

### The aim of this blog

This blog will hopefully serve as a platform for me to be me, mainly blogging about R and my research interests (and probably football).
