# Who am I?

I'm an ecologist studying how organisms adapt to change and how ecological processes scale from the very small (metabolism of a single cell) to the very big (ecosystem functions such as primary production).

I am interested in how and why communities coexist, and the feedbacks and indirect effects between ecological and evolutionary processes on species interactions within communities.

### The aim of this blog

This blog will hopefully serve as a platform for me to be me, mainly blogging about R and my research interests (and probably football).
