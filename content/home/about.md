# Who am I?

I'm an ecologist studying how organisms adapt to change and how these processes scale from the very small (cellular processes) to the very big (ecosystem processes).

I am currently doing a PhD in Cornwall under the supervision of Gabriel Yvon-Durocher, Angus Buckling and Simon Jennings.

### The aim of this blog

This blog will hopefully serve as a platform for me to be me, mainly blogging about R and my research interests (and probably football).

### My significant others

I live in Cornwall with my girlfriend Sophia Galpin (who documents her health and food adventures [here](http://spooniesophia.com)) and our 1 year old Miniature Dachshund Copper - who somehow manages to maintain his own [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/coppercar_thesausage/).

Without them I would lack the motivation and support to achieve what I have and what I will.
